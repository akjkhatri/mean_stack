# Data Types

Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.

There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories:

- primitive (or primary) // String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types
- composite (or reference) // Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types.
- special data types // Undefined and Null are special data types

Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities. Let's discuss each one of them in detail.

## String

The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters, as shown below:

```js
var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes
```

You can include quotes inside the string as long as they don't match the enclosing quotes.

```js
var a = "Let's have a cup of coffee."; // single quote inside double quotes
var b = 'He said "Hello" and left.';  // double quotes inside single quotes
var c = 'We\'ll never give up.';     // escaping single quote with backslash
```

## Number 

The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).

```js
var a = 25;         // integer
var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425
```

The Number data type also includes some special values which are: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN. Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity âˆž, which is greater than any number. Infinity is the result of dividing a nonzero number by 0, as demonstrated below:

```js
alert(16 / 0);  // Output: Infinity
alert(-16 / 0); // Output: -Infinity
alert(16 / -0); // Output: -Infinity
```


While NaN represents a special Not-a-Number value. It is a result of an invalid or an undefined mathematical operation, like taking the square root of -1 or dividing 0 by 0, etc.

```js
alert("Some text" / 2);       // Output: NaN
alert("Some text" / 2 + 10);  // Output: NaN
alert(Math.sqrt(-1));         // Output: NaN
```

## Boolean 

The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:

```js
var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping
```

Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons in a program. The following example compares two variables and shows the result in an alert dialog box:

```js
var a = 2, b = 5, c = 10;
 
alert(b > a) // Output: true
alert(b > c) // Output: false
```

## Undefined 

The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.

```js
var a;
var b = "Hello World!"
 
alert(a) // Output: undefined
alert(b) // Output: Hello World!
```


## Null

This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.

A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.

```js
var a = null;
alert(a); // Output: null
 
var b = "Hello World!"
alert(b); // Output: Hello World!
 
b = null;
alert(b) // Output: null
```


## Object 

The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.

An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects. You'll learn more about objects in upcoming chapters.

The following example will show you the simplest way to create an object in JavaScript.

```js
var emptyObject = {};
var person = {"name": "Clark", "surname": "Kent", "age": "36"};
 
// For better reading
var car = {
    "modal": "BMW X3",
    "color": "white",
    "doors": 5
}
```

You can omit the quotes around property name if the name is a valid JavaScript name. That means quotes are required around "first-name" but are optional around firstname. So the car object in the above example can also be written as:

```js
var car = {
    modal: "BMW X3",
    color: "white",
    doors: 5
}
```


## Array

An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].

The simplest way to create an array is by specifying the array elements as a comma-separated list enclosed by square brackets, as shown in the example below:

```js
var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
 
alert(colors[0]);   // Output: Red
alert(cities[2]);   // Output: New York
```


## Function 

The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables, as shown in the example below:

```js
var greeting = function(){ 
    return "Hello World!"; 
}
 
// Check the type of greeting variable
alert(typeof greeting) // Output: function
alert(greeting());     // Output: Hello World!
```

In fact, functions can be used at any place any other value can be used. Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and arrays. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, and functions can be returned from functions. Consider the following function:

```js
function createGreeting(name){
    return "Hello, " + name;
}
function displayGreeting(greetingFunction, userName){
    return greetingFunction(userName);
}
 
var result = displayGreeting(createGreeting, "Peter");
alert(result); // Output: Hello, Peter
```
