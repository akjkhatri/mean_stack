# Data types

A variable in JavaScript can contain any data. A variable can at one moment be a string and at another be a number:

```js
// no error
let message = "hello";
message = 123456;
```

Programming languages that allow such things are called "dynamically typed", meaning that there are data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.

There are seven basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we'll cover them in general.

## A number

```js
let n = 123;
n = 12.345;
```

The *number* type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication `*`, division `/`, addition `+`, subtraction `-`, and so on.


## A string

A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.

```js
let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
let phrase = `can embed ${str}`;
```

In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

1. Double quotes: `"Hello"`.
2. Single quotes: `'Hello'`.
3. Backticks: <code>&#96;Hello&#96;</code>.

Double and single quotes are "simple" quotes. There's no difference between them in JavaScript.

Backticks are "extended functionality" quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in `${â€¦}`, for example:

```js run
let name = "John";

// embed a variable
alert( `Hello, *!*${name}*/!*!` ); // Hello, John!

// embed an expression
alert( `the result is *!*${1 + 2}*/!*` ); // the result is 3
```


## A boolean (logical type)

The boolean type has only two values: `true` and `false`.

This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: `true` means "yes, correct", and `false` means "no, incorrect".

For instance:

```js
let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked
```

Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:

```js run
let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")
```


## The "null" value

The special `null` value does not belong to any of the types described above.

It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the `null` value:

```js
let age = null;
```

In JavaScript, `null` is not a "reference to a non-existing object" or a "null pointer" like in some other languages.

It's just a special value which represents "nothing", "empty" or "value unknown".

The code above states that `age` is unknown or empty for some reason.


## The "undefined" value

The special value `undefined` also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like `null`.

The meaning of `undefined` is "value is not assigned".

If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is `undefined`:

```js run
let x;

alert(x); // shows "undefined"
```


## Objects and Symbols

The `object` type is special.

All other types are called "primitive" because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.


## The typeof operator [#type-typeof]

The `typeof` operator returns the type of the argument. It's useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.

It supports two forms of syntax:

1. As an operator: `typeof x`.
2. As a function: `typeof(x)`.

The call to `typeof x` returns a string with the type name:

```js
typeof undefined // "undefined"

typeof 0 // "number"

typeof true // "boolean"

typeof "foo" // "string"

typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"

*!*
typeof Math // "object"  (1)
*/!*

*!*
typeof null // "object"  (2)
*/!*

*!*
typeof alert // "function"  (3)
*/!*
```
