# Functions

Functions are the main "building blocks" of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.

## Function Declaration

To create a function we can use a *function declaration*.

It looks like this:

```js
function showMessage() {
  alert( 'Hello everyone!' );
}
```

The `function` keyword goes first, then goes the *name of the function*, then a list of *parameters* between the parentheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above) and finally the code of the function, also named "the function body", between curly braces.

```js
function name(parameters) {
  ...body...
}
```

Our new function can be called by its name: `showMessage()`.

For instance:

```js run
function showMessage() {
  alert( 'Hello everyone!' );
}

*!*
showMessage();
showMessage();
*/!*
```

## Parameters

We can pass arbitrary data to functions using parameters (also called *function arguments*) .

In the example below, the function has two parameters: `from` and `text`.

```js run
function showMessage(*!*from, text*/!*) { // arguments: from, text
  alert(from + ': ' + text);
}

*!*
showMessage('Ann', 'Hello!'); // Ann: Hello! (*)
showMessage('Ann', "What's up?"); // Ann: What's up? (**)
*/!*
```

When the function is called in lines `(*)` and `(**)`, the given values are copied to local variables `from` and `text`. Then the function uses them.

Here's one more example: we have a variable `from` and pass it to the function. Please note: the function changes `from`, but the change is not seen outside, because a function always gets a copy of the value:


```js run
function showMessage(from, text) {

*!*
  from = '*' + from + '*'; // make "from" look nicer
*/!*

  alert( from + ': ' + text );
}

let from = "Ann";

showMessage(from, "Hello"); // *Ann*: Hello

// the value of "from" is the same, the function modified a local copy
alert( from ); // Ann
```


## Returning a value

A function can return a value back into the calling code as the result.

The simplest example would be a function that sums two values:

```js run no-beautify
function sum(a, b) {
  *!*return*/!* a + b;
}

let result = sum(1, 2);
alert( result ); // 3
```

The directive `return` can be in any place of the function. When the execution reaches it, the function stops, and the value is returned to the calling code (assigned to `result` above).

There may be many occurrences of `return` in a single function. For instance:

```js run
function checkAge(age) {
  if (age > 18) {
*!*
    return true;
*/!*
  } else {
*!*
    return confirm('Do you have permission from your parents?');
*/!*
  }
}

let age = prompt('How old are you?', 18);

if ( checkAge(age) ) {
  alert( 'Access granted' );
} else {
  alert( 'Access denied' );
}
```

It is possible to use `return` without a value. That causes the function to exit immediately.

For example:

```js
function showMovie(age) {
  if ( !checkAge(age) ) {
*!*
    return;
*/!*
  }

  alert( "Showing you the movie" ); // (*)
  // ...
}
```

In the code above, if `checkAge(age)` returns `false`, then `showMovie` won't proceed to the `alert`.

````smart header="A function with an empty `return` or without it returns `undefined`"
If a function does not return a value, it is the same as if it returns `undefined`:

```js run
function doNothing() { /* empty */ }

alert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true
```

An empty `return` is also the same as `return undefined`:

```js run
function doNothing() {
  return;
}

alert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true
```
````

````warn header="Never add a newline between `return` and the value"
For a long expression in `return`, it might be tempting to put it on a separate line, like this:

```js
return
 (some + long + expression + or + whatever * f(a) + f(b))
```
That doesn't work, because JavaScript assumes a semicolon after `return`. That'll work the same as:

```js
return*!*;*/!*
 (some + long + expression + or + whatever * f(a) + f(b))
```

So, it effectively becomes an empty return.

If we want the returned expression to wrap across multiple lines, we should start it at the same line as `return`. Or at least put the opening parentheses there as follows:

```js
return (
  some + long + expression
  + or +
  whatever * f(a) + f(b)
  )
```
And it will work just as we expect it to.

## Naming a function [#function-naming]

Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does.

It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. There must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes.

For instance, functions that start with `"show"` usually show something.

Function starting with...

- `"get…"` -- return a value,
- `"calc…"` -- calculate something,
- `"create…"` -- create something,
- `"check…"` -- check something and return a boolean, etc.

Examples of such names:

```js no-beautify
showMessage(..)     // shows a message
getAge(..)          // returns the age (gets it somehow)
calcSum(..)         // calculates a sum and returns the result
createForm(..)      // creates a form (and usually returns it)
checkPermission(..) // checks a permission, returns true/false
```

With prefixes in place, a glance at a function name gives an understanding what kind of work it does and what kind of value it returns.

```smart header="One function -- one action"
A function should do exactly what is suggested by its name, no more.

Two independent actions usually deserve two functions, even if they are usually called together (in that case we can make a 3rd function that calls those two).

A few examples of breaking this rule:

- `getAge` -- would be bad if it shows an `alert` with the age (should only get).
- `createForm` -- would be bad if it modifies the document, adding a form to it (should only create it and return).
- `checkPermission` -- would be bad if it displays the `access granted/denied` message (should only perform the check and return the result).

These examples assume common meanings of prefixes. You and your team are free to agree on other meanings, but usually they're not much different. In any case, you should have a firm understanding of what a prefix means, what a prefixed function can and cannot do. All same-prefixed functions should obey the rules. And the team should share the knowledge.
```

```smart header="Ultrashort function names"
Functions that are used *very often* sometimes have ultrashort names.

For example, the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) framework defines a function with `$`. The [Lodash](http://lodash.com/) library has its core function named `_`.

These are exceptions. Generally functions names should be concise and descriptive.
```

## Functions == Comments

Functions should be short and do exactly one thing. If that thing is big, maybe it's worth it to split the function into a few smaller functions. Sometimes following this rule may not be that easy, but it's definitely a good thing.

A separate function is not only easier to test and debug -- its very existence is a great comment!

For instance, compare the two functions `showPrimes(n)` below. Each one outputs [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) up to `n`.

The first variant uses a label:

```js
function showPrimes(n) {
  nextPrime: for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {

    for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) {
      if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime;
    }

    alert( i ); // a prime
  }
}
```

The second variant uses an additional function `isPrime(n)` to test for primality:

```js
function showPrimes(n) {

  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    *!*if (!isPrime(i)) continue;*/!*

    alert(i);  // a prime
  }
}

function isPrime(n) {
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    if ( n % i == 0) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

The second variant is easier to understand, isn't it? Instead of the code piece we see a name of the action (`isPrime`). Sometimes people refer to such code as *self-describing*.

So, functions can be created even if we don't intend to reuse them. They structure the code and make it readable.
